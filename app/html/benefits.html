                    <p>This is the most attractive part of Beacon technology. It creates a constant and locally responsive billboard right in the palm of your memberâ€™s hands. Say your member is walking past your juice bar... they can receive an instant coupon or other incentive in order to drive a purchase. This can be applied to all other areas of your club such as PT, merchandise, and fitness classes. The message would appear on your Club Mobile App.

                    <p class="head">Personalized Messaging</p>
                    <p>By interacting with your CRM, the beacon can use information about members to tailor messages to them. If a members has frequented spin classes in the past, the beacon can send a push notification prompting them to sign up for more classes the next time they walk past the spin studio. Similar to today, signing up for the class would be done seamlessly from your Club Mobile App on members' smartphones.
